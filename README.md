# Go Fun Project

## Introduction

This is a simple git project to learn and explore GO in various aspects and respects. I've been coding with Javascript for almost a decade now, venturing out ever so often into Java, Ruby, Python, and PHP, but never comfortable enough in any as much as Javascript. I've realized throghout the years, that this is a crutch that has stopped my progression as a developer. Learning GO will help me build a solid foundation outside of JavaScript and allow me to build safe and efficient code for use in various projects going forward.
